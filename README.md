## How to run 
after downloading codes to vm, run `make qemu-nox` for running emulator.

Note: I recommend re-run the emulator when testing a new test, because sometimes there are bizarre results when eulator is keep running.

## Test1 
after entering emulator, type `test1` to run and see the result of test1

## Test2 
after entering emulator, type `test2` to run and see the result of test2. 
Note: test2 has zombie processes after running, not sure why is that. However, the produced result should show boosting.

## Test3
after entering emulator, type `test3` to run and see the result of test3. 

## Graphs
graphs are files labelled "p3-graph1.pdf", "p3-graph2.pdf" etc.
